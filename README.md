# tsck-hologram-server

This program takes as its argument a video file, and then displays it in a format intended to be used with a psuedo-holographic pyramid display, such as [this one](https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Pyramid-Hologram/). It also serves a web page on port 8000 to allow configuring the video in real time.
